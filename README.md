# Battle Noughts and Crosses
## Introduction
This is a simple twist on a classic game. In this game, each player has five player pieces. One is the normal boring X or O. The other four are OP.
- X/O+ (The Warrior) Will battle an opponent piece on a random adjacent space.
- X/O- (The Fixer) Will erase a piece on a random adjacent square.
- X/O* (The Breeder) Will spawn a matching piece in a random empty adjacent space.
- X/O/ (The Usurper) Will trade places with an opponent piece in a random adjacent space.

But beware! If your Warrior loses the battle or your Usurper trades places with the wrong piece, you may give the win to your opponent. One thing is for sure: In Battle Noughts & Crosses, there will ALWAYS be a victor!

## Helpful Notes
### Disclosure
**This is a minimum viable product. (MVP)**

It is said that man can't be good at everything. This game is fun, but as you can tell, the actual interface leaves a lot to be desired. When it comes to web development, I am proficient in the backend and logic, but I lack in the area of frontend creation.  ***Please contribute!***
